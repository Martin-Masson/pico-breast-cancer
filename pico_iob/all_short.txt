awareness O

the O

However O

A O
more O

, O

We O

that O
this O

Multifocal O

been O
suggested O

a O

drain O

Over O

, O
chemotherapy O
has O
played O
an O
important O
role O
in O
prolonging O

in O

With O

the O

, O
the O
occurrence O

. O

Several O
strategies O
use O
lamivudine O
to O
deal O
with O
this O
problem O

Initially O

However O

Later O
studies O
have O
suggested O
that O
prophylactic O
lamivudine O

its O

However O
, O
these O
studies O

based O
mainly O
on O

whereas O
studies O

Moreover O
, O
these O

were O
retrospective O

Recently O
, O
a O

recommended O
that O
deferred O

could O
be O
a O
comparable O
alternative O
to O
the O

The O

Application O

Thus O
