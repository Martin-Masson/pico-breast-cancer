? O
Over O
the O
past O
four O
decades O
, O
chemotherapy O
has O
played O
an O
important O
role O
in O
prolonging O
survival O
in O
breast O
cancer O
patients O
. O
However O
, O
it O
may O
also O
result O
in O
undesirable O
side O
effects O
such O
as O
hepatitis O
B O
virus O
( O
HBV O
) O
reactivation O
seen O
in O
this O
study O
. O
With O
the O
increasing O
use O
of O
chemotherapy O
paralleling O
the O
rise O
in O
breast O
cancer O
incidence O
, O
the O
occurrence O
of O
HBV O
reactivation O
is O
likely O
to O
further O
increase O
. O
Several O
strategies O
use O
lamivudine O
to O
deal O
with O
this O
problem O
. O
Initially O
, O
lamivudine O
had O
been O
used O
to O
treat O
patients O
who O
developed O
alanine O
transaminase O

attributable O
to O
HBV O
reactivation O
during O
chemotherapy O
. O
However O
, O
using O
this O
strategy O
, O
fatal O
reactivation O
has O
also O
been O
reported O
. O
Later O
studies O
have O
suggested O
that O
prophylactic O
lamivudine O
significantly O
reduces O
HBV O
reactivation O
and O
its O
associated O
morbidity O
. O
However O
, O
these O
studies O
were O
based O
mainly O
on O
patients O
with O
lymphoma O
, O
whereas O
studies O
on O
breast O
cancer O
patients O
were O
few O
. O
Moreover O
, O
these O
studies O
were O
retrospective O
. O
Recently O
, O
a O
prospective O
study O
has O
recommended O
that O
deferred O
preemptive O
lamivudine O
could O
be O
a O
comparable O
alternative O
to O
the O
prophylactic O
strategy O
. O
However O
, O
it O
was O
not O
a O
randomized O
controlled O
study O
. O
In O
this O
study O
, O
it O
was O
examined O

of O
the O
prophylactic O

Two O
groups O
were O
studied O
. O
One O
group O
consisted O
of O
21 B-intervention-participants
patients O
who O
were O
treated O
with O
prophylactic O
lamivudine O
, O
the O
other O
group O
consisted O
of O
21 B-control-participants
patients O
who O
were O
not B-control
treated I-control
with I-control
prophylactic I-control
lamivudine I-control
. O
The O
results O
showed O
that O
the O
prophylactic O
lamivudine O
strategy O
significantly O
decreased O
the O
