After O

patients O
in O
both O

received O
adjuvant O

Thirty O
women O

a O

eight O
women O
in O
the O

(P<0.001). O
The O
crude O

incidence O
of O
these O

was O
8.8 O

and O
2.3 O
percent, O

after O

In O

there O
was O
no O

the O

After O

the O
rate O

was O
41.7 O

that O
underwent O
breast-conserving O

and O
41.2 O

in O
the O

(P=1.0). O
The O

rates O

were O
26.1 O

The O

The O

during O

Over O
the O
past O
four O
decades, O
chemotherapy O
has O
played O
an O
important O
role O
in O
prolonging O
survival O
in O
breast O
cancer O
patients. O
However, O
it O
may O
also O
result O
in O
undesirable O
side O
effects O
such O
as O
hepatitis O
B O
virus O
(HBV) O
reactivation O
seen O
in O
this O
study. O
With O
the O
increasing O
use O
of O
chemotherapy O
paralleling O
the O
rise O
in O
breast O
cancer O
incidence, O
the O
occurrence O
of O
HBV O
reactivation O
is O
likely O
to O
further O
increase. O
Several O
strategies O
use O
lamivudine O
to O
deal O
with O
this O
problem. O
Initially, O
lamivudine O
had O
been O
used O
to O
treat O
patients O
who O
developed O
alanine O
transaminase O
elevation O
attributable O
to O
HBV O
reactivation O
during O
chemotherapy. O
However, O
using O
this O
strategy, O
fatal O
reactivation O
has O
also O
been O
reported. O
Later O
studies O
have O
suggested O
that O
prophylactic O
lamivudine O
significantly O
reduces O
HBV O
reactivation O
and O
its O
associated O
morbidity. O
However, O
these O
studies O
were O
based O
mainly O
on O
patients O
with O
lymphoma, O
whereas O
studies O
on O
breast O
cancer O
patients O
were O
few. O
Moreover, O
these O
studies O
were O
retrospective. O
Recently, O
a O
prospective O
study O
has O
recommended O
that O
deferred O
preemptive O
lamivudine O
could O
be O
a O
comparable O
alternative O
to O
the O
prophylactic O
strategy. O
However, O
it O
was O
not O
a O
randomized O
controlled O
study. O
In O
this O
study, O
it O
was O
examined O
the O
efficacy O
of O
the O
prophylactic O
strategy O
in O
hepatitis O
B O
s-antigen O
seropositive O
breast O
cancer O
patients O
during O
chemotherapy O
using O
a O
prospective, O
randomized O
controlled O
study. O
Two O
groups O
were O
studied. O
One O
group O
consisted O
of O
21 intervention-participants
patients O
who O
were O
treated O
with O
prophylactic O
lamivudine, O
the O
other O
group O
consisted O
of O
21 control-participants
patients O
who O
were O
not control
treated control
with control
prophylactic control

The O
results O
showed O
that O
the O

significantly O

(0 O

Cancer-related O

a O

Exercise O
appears O

Resistance O

an O

been O
minimally O
investigated, O

counteract O
muscle O

by O

chemotherapeutics, O
and O
thus O
forestall O
or O
reduce O

Previous O

the O

Therefore, O
it O

the O
observed O

Exercise O

that O

Previously, O

stopped O

had O
no O

Aging O

blunt O
the O

we O

We O

Age O
moderated O
the O
effect O

such O
that O

were O
more O

the O
use O

more O

Mammographic O

is O
a O

for O

The O
causes O

and, O
therefore, O
to O

are O
still O

However, O
a O
treatment O
strategy O

the O

may O
bring O
about O
very O

clinical O
outcomes O

Myo-inositol O

a O
six-fold O

Similarly, O
boswellic O

and O
betaine O
(three-methyl O

both O
inhibit O

Based O
on O

scientific O
background, O
we O
hypothesized O
that O
a O

boswellic O

betaine O
and O
myo-inositol O
would O
be O
able O
to O
reduce O

In O

the O

After O

Preliminary O

the O

assumptions, O
that O
the O
association O
comprising O
boswellic O

myo-inositol O
significantly O
reduces O

providing O
the O

that O

Considering O
that O

This O

Results O

that O
progressive O

is O
safe, O

the O

The O

The O

the O

although O
this O

significantly O
different O
(P O

INBCL O
for O
NBCs O
was O
more O
accurate O
than O
WL, O
because O
it O
optimized O
the O

A O

Therefore O
INBCL O

The O

Gail's O

used O
to O

the O
probability O
(risk) O

over O
time. O
Tamoxifen O
reduced O
the O
risk O
of O
invasive O
breast O
cancer O
by O
49% O
(two-sided O
P<.00001), O
with O

The O

in O

(44%), O
50-59 O

(86%) O
and O
in O

risk. O
Tamoxifen O
reduced O
the O
risk O
of O
noninvasive O
breast O
cancer O
by O
50% O
(two-sided O
P<.002). O
Tamoxifen O
reduced O
the O
occurrence O
of O
estrogen O
receptor-positive O
tumors O
by O
69%, O
but O
no O
difference O
in O
the O
occurrence O

was O
seen. O
Tamoxifen O
administration O
did O
not O
alter O
the O
average O
annual O
rate O
of O
ischemic O
heart O
disease; O
however, O
a O
reduction O
in O
hip, O
radius O
(Colles'), O
and O
spine O
fractures O
was O
observed. O
The O
rate O
of O
endometrial O
cancer O
was O
increased O
in O
the O
tamoxifen O
group O
(risk O
ratio O

2.53; O

1.35-4.97); O
this O
increased O

in O
women O

older. O
All O
endometrial O
cancers O
in O
the O
tamoxifen O
group O
were O
stage O
I O
(localized O
disease); O
no O
endometrial O
cancer O
deaths O
have O

in O
this O

No O
liver O

or O
increase O
in O
colon, O
rectal, O
ovarian, O

other O
tumors O

observed O
in O
the O
tamoxifen O
group. O
The O
rates O
of O
stroke, O
pulmonary O
embolism, O
and O
deep-vein O
thrombosis O
were O
elevated O
in O
the O
tamoxifen O
group; O
these O
events O
occurred O

frequently O
in O
women O

50 O

Tamoxifen O
decreases O
the O

invasive O

noninvasive O
breast O
cancer. O
Despite O
side O
effects O
resulting O
from O
administration O
of O
tamoxifen, O
its O
use O
as O
a O
